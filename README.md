18 years on software development, I‚Äôve done a lot of things and I love what I do. I also love to learn and to teach. I like to be in touch with new and bleeding edge technologies and to try new philosophies and paradigms. I don‚Äôt accept the ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù and things must make sense for me and for you. I think unanimity is dangerous but I truly believe in consensus. People before processes but I believe processes can lead to freedom sometimes. Without continuous improvement the agility is only utopia. Feel free to question me, I‚Äôll certainly question you.
